Hi, I’m Jermaine — a multidisciplinary designer and front-end developer with a background in studio art, motion graphics, and email development. I love blending creativity with code to craft visually compelling, functional digital experiences. My toolkit includes HTML5, JavaScript, Python, AMPscript, Litmus, Salesforce, the Adobe Suite and Figma.
